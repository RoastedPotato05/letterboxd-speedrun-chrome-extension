# Letterboxd Speedrun Chrome Extension #
## (similar to wikipedia speedruns if you're familiar with those)
  
## To run:  

1. Download zip to a directory and unpack

2. In Chrome, go to your extensions and turn on 'Developer mode' at the top right corner

3. Click the 'Load unpacked' button that should appear at the top left after turning on developer mode

4. Select the folder that you unpacked the code into

5. Open a tab to letterboxd.com and run the extension, navigate to whatever page you want to start from

6. In another tab or window find your target letterboxd page, can be a movie, actor/actress, director etc.

7. Copy/paste the URL of the target page in the 'GOAL' input box, and the timer will start

8. Navigate however you'd like to the target page only using redirects on the letterboxd page, your path will automatically be listed
  

## Note:
  Pretty much any redirect should work from a movie or cast's page, as a rule I usually limit myself to only cast/crew for movies, and no MCU because everyone's in the MCU
